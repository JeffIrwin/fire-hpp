## Conan usage

Fire can be packaged for consumption through Conan by running `conan create . fire-hpp/version@user/channel` from the root directory of this repository. It can then be consumed as in the `find_package()` [example](https://github.com/kongaskristjan/fire-hpp/docs/cmake.md#find_package) if using `cmake_find_package` generator.
